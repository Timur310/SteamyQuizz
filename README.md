Small project where I learn webhooks and multiplayer online interactions trough fun steam quizzes. The projects uses steam's public store api to retrieve reviews and system requirements which the users need to guess based on 3 randomly selected game from steamAppId.json. The project uses Bun - React - Socket.io This is a direct rewrite of my old offline steam quizz project.
